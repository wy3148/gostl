# The motivation of writing gostl
gostl has implemented similar C++/STL containers, while official golang package doesn't provide them directly. 
It is known that go slice and map are very powerful data containers, and indeed they are very helpful.
However, In some user cases, we may still need STL-like containers, such as queue, priority_queue, stack and etc.
And I've been always learning and improving golang coding skills, this is one of the motoviations to write gostl as well.
So far, most of packages are still under writing and testing, any suggestions will be much appreciated!
