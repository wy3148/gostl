# The motivation of writing gostl
gostl has implemented similar C++/STL containers, while official golang package doesn't provide them directly. <b>

It is known that go slice and map are very powerful data containers, and indeed they are very helpful. <b>

However, In some user cases, we may still need STL-like containers, such as queue, priority_queue, stack and etc.<b>

And I've been always learning and improving golang coding skills, this is one of the motoviations to write gostl as well.<b>

So far, most of packages are still under writing and testing, any suggestions will be much appreciated!<b>
